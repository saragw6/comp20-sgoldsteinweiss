Successes and Faliures
----------------------

I completed the following aspects successfully:
•Messages are displayed in the "log" section with latest message displayed first, at the top
•Messages are redisplayed (from local storage) on return to the page
•readable time stamp followed by " - " followed by message

And did not implement anything incorrectly, as far as I know.
