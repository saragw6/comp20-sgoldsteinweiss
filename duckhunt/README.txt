Successes and Faliures
----------------------

I completed the following aspects successfully:
•modified game.js file to draw the background and two ducks on the canvas
•did not modify HTML, CSS, or sprite sheet files
•used drawImage() and getContext() succesfully

And did not implement anything incorrectly, as far as I know.
