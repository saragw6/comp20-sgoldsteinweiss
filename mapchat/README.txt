----------------------
Successes and Faliures
----------------------

I completed the following aspects successfully:
•used a file named index.html in a folder named mapchat
•used a CSS file
•used navigator.geolocation to retrieve geolocation info
•used XMLHttpRequest to make requests and manage response data
•displayed my location on the map with a unique marker and the login
•displayed locations of people on the map and info window that displays person's login, message, and mile(s) away from me

And did not implement anything incorrectly, as far as I know.
