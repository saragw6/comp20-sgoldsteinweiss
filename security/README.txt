Successes and Faliures
----------------------

I completed the following aspects successfully:
•Introduction provides a description of the product and what I was hired to do
•Methodology describes my methods including the tools I used (none)
•Abstract provides an overview of all the security and privacy issues I identified in lay language
•For each issue found I document the issue, location, severity, description, proof, and resolution

As far as incorrect implementations, I am fairly certain I missed some vulnerabilities but I simply ran out of time after spending a lot of time reading up on security in order to wrap my head around the assignment.
