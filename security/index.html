<h1>Security Assessment of Mapchat and Quiet-Anchorage-5729</h1>

<p>Prepared by <a href="http://saragw6.github.io">Sara Goldstein-Weiss</a> &bull; 12/9/15</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mapchat and Quiet-Anchorage-5729 are a pair of web pages that work with a database of timestamped checkins sent by MapChat users including a login, longitude and latitude coordinates, and a message. Mapchat retrieves your current location and sends your current location with a message to a datastore. It then retrieves and displays the locations and messages of users who have sent their locations to the datastore. Quiet-Anchorage-5729 is a web application that maintains location check-ins (login, latitude, longitude, message) for a long period of time. It has a /sendLocation API through which users can send a checkin, a /latest.json API that returns the last known location of a login as a JSON string of a single object, and an index or home page which displays a list of the check-ins and messages for all logins sorted in descending order by timestamp.</p>

<p>My job was to perform a security assessment and find vulnerabilities in the code which would allow hackers to break the web page or otherwise maliciously manipulate the code.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

I first did a black-box test of the product, in an attempt to break the web page with only the information available to a hacker. Through this I found multiple security breaches and even broke the code. I also looked to the source and inspected the code carefully to find more vulnerabilities.

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

Unsurprisingly, a great deal of vulnerability came from the sendLocation aspect of Quiet-Anchorage-5729. The information sent in the POST request was incorporated into a database and later displayed in the home page. This left the product open to a number of attacks, so the inputs need to be checked so that only permissible characters are allowed. Also, currently anyone is allowed to send a checkin. Some sort of credentials should be checked before a checkin is accepted from a given origin.

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Cross-Site Scripting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Affects /latest.json API
<ul><li><span class="mod">Moderate</span>: this flaw makes Quiet-Anchorage-5729 a significant security risk for other sites (such as MapChat) that expect it to handle data correctly, so it poses a big problem for the site's reputation with its clients. Luckily, the issue is easily-resolvable, and malicious checkins can be removed from the Mongo database.</li>
<li>Data sent to the sendLocation API isn't escaped, so it might include evil code in place of a longitude or latitude coordinate or a message.</li>
<li>I found this by inserting an iframe into the latitude of my checkin like so: <code>curl --data "login=TomDapper&lat=&lt;iframe src='http://omfgdogs.com'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lng=10&message=lol" http://quiet-anchorage-5729.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code> This sort of attack can affect a client who wants to use the information from /latest.json. For example, if they wanted to mark TomDapper's latest location on a map, this json object would make that impossible:</li>
<table class="galleryTable">
<p><img src="xssexample1.png" alt="example of xss vulnerability" title="XSS example 1" border=1px/></p>
</table></li>
<li>This issue can be resolved by escaping user input before it enters the database. For example, commonly-dangerous characters can be escaped to their HTML-code equivalents, then the input can be filtered through a whitelist of allowable characters, such as <code>str.match(/[\d\w\s\]|[\~\!\@\#\$\^\*\-\_\+\;]*/g).join('');</code>. This same escaping can be applied retroactively using <code>db.collection.update()</code>.</li>
</ul></li> <!--recommendation source: Gabe Joseph's report http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/security-gjoseph/report.html -->
</li>

<li>Affects Home page
<ul>
<li><span class="high">High</span>: a simple attack has rendered the home page useless, and any clients visiting the site will lose all trust in its abilities</li>
<li>I found this by inserting an iframe into the latitude of my checkin like so: <code>curl --data "login=TomDapper&lat=10&lng=10&message=&lt;script>window.location=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiQunMgbYAo\";</script>" http://quiet-anchorage-5729.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code> Now if anyone wants to visit the home page to see the latest checkins, they will end up viewing this video instead:</li>
</li>
<table class="galleryTable">
<p><img src="xssexample2.png" alt="example of xss vulnerability" title="XSS example 2" border=1px/></p>
</table>
<li>This issue can be resolved as above, this instance of it merely makes it more dire.</li></ul></li>

</ul></li></ul>
<li><p><strong>CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Affects POST and GET APIs</li>
<li><span class="mod">Moderate</span>: Hackers could send data from any origin. Easily fixed, though.</li>
<li>I found this by looking at the original source code. The GET and POST APIs needed to allow CORS in order to function. However, this web page used the '*' wildcard to allow all origins to complete requests, opening the page up to all sorts of attacks. This is a big gap in security, but has an easy enough fix.</li>
<li>If we set some credentials instead of allowing requests from any origin, we can greatly increase security. This can be done by using a modifier like 'withCredentials' rather than the wildcard '*'.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Several security vulnerabilities exist in this web page. However, they are fairly simple to fix with simply a few lines of code here or there. These small changes in code will make a big difference in the quality of the product. Though the solutions are small changes to the source code, the potential problems caused by these security breaches were enormous.
